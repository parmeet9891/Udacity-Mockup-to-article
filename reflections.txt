Your response goes here!

1. I have learned about a lot of new HTML stuff. I learned about structure, HTML trees, how to start and close the tags, making code from tree and can easily judge by observing a picture that which HTML is fairly used here.

2. Easy i guess isn't anything. Initially its always difficult to memorize everything. But now as i said judging is easy for me. I can judge about the which HTML tag is being used so far. I can write the very basic structure of HTML by starting from DOCTYPE and ending up to closing tag of HTML. 

3. Difficult could be bugs, when they strike it becomes a little messy. You have everything correct but solution is not matching till end. But still i learned fighting those bugs according to the situation.

4. I have used various techniques to overcome this.
	4.1 Started observing my code and finding the errors.
	4.2 If don't get any success, Try finidng out in the references or my favourite search engine.
	4.3 Still no success, then leave the work for a while keeping myself fresh and then starts again.
	4.4 The experience has been increasing. New ways coming out to handle errors and hence more knowledge is being collected. What happened next, I am 	                           excited.
